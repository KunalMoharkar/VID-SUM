# VID-SUM
## Submission of team ASP for Hack36 2021.
### Theme - Education

### Topic - Video Summarization

#### Introduction

Gone are the days when studies meant going over long textbooks, trying to grasp what the authors have written. Now everyone prefers video platforms such as Youtube, Udemy or some other video platform to learn. Sometimes students also have recorded lectures of their teachers which they can rewatch before exams, especially due to virtual teaching, this has only increased. Sometimes, even these videos are a bit long, and nobody likes big videos.

### ENTER VID-SUM.

What our project does is, it summarises any video, extracting only the regions in the video which are important and you have a short and sweet summary video that you can watch easily in less time and get the same information you would have got watching the whole video.

It does this by using the subtitles of the video.
